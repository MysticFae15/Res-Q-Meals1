# Res-Q-Meals1
A live interactive platform that connects local restaurants with food banks, orphanages, and NGOs in real time to donate excess food before it’s wasted.
#Problem Statement:
Every year, tons of edible food goes to waste while millions of people go hungry. Restaurants often have surplus food that could be donated but lack a structured way to connect with local NGOs, orphanages, or food banks.
#This project solves that problem by providing a real-time interactive platform where:
• Restaurants can list surplus food quickly. • NGOs can view donations nearby. • Routes and logistics are simplified through map integration.
This project isn't just about maps or food. It's about solving hunger with code — using what we know to help those in need.
